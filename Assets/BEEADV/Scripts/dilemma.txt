One of the fields, we used to enjoy lavender is gone; now we have to find other sources to make up for it.
The mean wasps came again. They harmed my sisters and ruined our food; now we have to redo everything. We need you to help collect more pollen for us. 
Part of our hive was knock over and we lost a lot of honey. We have to work fast to recover it all!
Wasps hurt my sisters while they were out. I have to take over their pollen collecting!
Oh no, my baby sisters got sick with a fungus. I need to gather nectar to make them feel better and pollen to replace their rooms.
How rude! Some other hive came and stole some of our honey! Please help me find more nectar and pollen to replace the stolen honey.
Some of my sisters got mites on their backs. Until they get those pesky bugs off their backs I have to take over in gather pollen.
There was a big ugly bear that attacked us! I'm scared to go out, but we need pollen to rebuild our home.
Somebody sprayed medicine on us to try make us healthier, but it made many of us sick instead. I need more pollen to help my sick sisters.
Oh geez, some of my sisters likes the taste of powder sugar that the farmers give us more than the natural nectar we eat and stopped working. I need to collect their share of nectar and pollen until they stop being dumb.
Some of the flowers we got yesterday tasted funny and made us feel sick. I don't feel too bad but I need to help my sisters by collecting as much pollen as I can.
A big ugly raccoon came and stole honey! We need to rebuild and restore pollen as fast as possible!
It's been raining too much lately; not many of us went outside yesterday. We need to work extra hard today to make up for lost work.
It's too hot! Some of the honey dried up and we need to replace it as soon as possible with nectar!
